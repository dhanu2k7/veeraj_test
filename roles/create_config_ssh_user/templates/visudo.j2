# Version control
# V1.0.0 - shan.sunny@in.ibm.com - for Science Logic monitoring to work 
#
# There are requirements for log file monitoring for every customer to monitor different log files in different paths.
# The Vendor has built a separate new solution specifically for IBM and Hence the same is not available in vendor documentation yet. Link for the vendor email statement on the same is mentioned below
# https://ibm.box.com/s/s5sssyobv1vvlwaoulsicemn4mv1lzxa
# Limiting to scoped commands will limit the future monitoring enhanancements provided by the vendor.
