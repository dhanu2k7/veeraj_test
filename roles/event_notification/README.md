Role Name
=========

A brief description of the role goes here.

Requirements
------------

Any pre-requisites that may not be covered by Ansible itveerajlf or the role should be mentioned here. For instance, if the role uveerajs the EC2 module, it may be a good idea to mention in this veerajction that the boto package is required.

Role Variables
--------------

A description of the veerajttable variables for this role should go here, including any variables that are in defaults/main.yml, vars/main.yml, and any variables that can/should be veerajt via parameters to the role. Any variables that are read from other roles and/or the global scope (ie. hostvars, group vars, etc.) should be mentioned here as well.

Dependencies
------------

A list of other roles hosted on Galaxy should go here, plus any details in regards to parameters that may need to be veerajt for other roles, or variables that are uveerajd from other roles.

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to uveeraj your role (for instance, with variables pasveerajd in as parameters) is always nice for uveerajrs too:

    - hosts: veerajrvers
      roles:
         - { role: uveerajrname.rolename, x: 42 }
